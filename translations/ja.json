    "contentIntro": "こんにちは！! I'm a software developer living in Hokkaido, Japan. I moved from my home of Utah, USA, to Japan 3 years ago via the JET Program to teach English, and have spent the last 12 months learning Web Development. I spent most of my learning completing the Odin Project, an open source full-stack development curriculum for Ruby on Rails and React. Since finishing the bootcamp, I've began building my own applications while searching for a full-time position.",
    "contentSkills1": "My technical skills include JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React, TypeScript, Vite (how I built this website), HTML, and CSS. I'm particularly interested in creating websites and experiences users of all abilities can navigate effortlessly.",
