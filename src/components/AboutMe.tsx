            Hi, I'm Nolan! I'm a software developer living in Hokkaido, Japan. I
            moved from my home of Utah, USA, to Japan 3 years ago via the JET
            Program to teach English, and have spent the last 12 months learning
            Web Development. I spent most of my learning completing the Odin
            Project, an open source full-stack development curriculum for Ruby
            on Rails and React. Since finishing the bootcamp, I've began
            building my own applications while searching for a full-time
            position.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-medium">
            My technical skills include JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, React,
            TypeScript, Vite (how I built this website), HTML, and CSS. I'm
            particularly interested in creating websites and experiences users
            of all abilities can navigate effortlessly.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-medium">
            I am also fluent in Japanese and JLPT N2 Certification (January,
            2023). I can listen, speak, and read confidently, and am aiming
            towards N1 Certification.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg font-medium">
            When I'm not coding, you can find me reading about Ancient Rome,
            playing basketball, or spending time with my wonderful wife.
